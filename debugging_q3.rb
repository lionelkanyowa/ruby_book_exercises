#What is exception handling and what does it solve?

=begin
Exception handling is a process that deals with with errors in a way that can be understood by the user.
Think of it as a debugging tool that makes handling errors much easir. 
It helps to handle and resolve an error by changing the flow of control without exiting the program entirely.
